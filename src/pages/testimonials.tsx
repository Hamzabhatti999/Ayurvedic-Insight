        <p>
          Thanks so much for the wonderful sessions. Monika, you have taken me
          out of the deep dungeon of lethargy and depression which was really
          taking a toll on my life. I was in so much pain for almost three years
          and my doctor said it was nothing but depression and prescribed me
          anti-depressant medication. Then I thought of consulting you and that
          was the best decision I made. With your help my depression is gone, I
          feel better and have started to enjoy life once again and that too
          without all the horrible side effects of modern medicine. Thanks for
          turning my life around. K.S. Fresno, CA The changes we've noticed in
          the yoga students who are practicing Ayurveda with you are astounding.
          I asked one woman today, do you feel as good as you look? Her answer
          was YES! We see that with your guidance and inspiration, you are
          helping people to live life in a happy, healthy body. Thank you for
          sharing your love and knowledge of Ayurvedic Medicine with us. Michael
          and Melinda Downing, Directors of Yoga For Living, Fresno, CA I am a
          patient of Monika Joshi for almost 4 months. Before the ayurvedic
          treatment I had been taking a pain medication, prescribed by my
          doctor. The medicine was to be taken only for a short period of time,
          so I switched over to ayurvedic treatment. I am satisfied with Mrs.
          Joshi's way of treating patients as she attends to them nicely. She is
          very concerned for her patients and is always willing to help them,
          whether it is regarding consultation for a medicine or regarding a
          good and healthy diet. She was available whenever I wanted an
          appointment with her. I am happy with the ayurvedic treatment as it
          helps cure the illness with no side effects. S.G. Fresno, CA I’ve only
          known Monika and the practice of Ayurveda for a few months now but the
          teachings have been life changing. I am learning to let go of the
          past, not dwell on the uncertainty of the future and most important to
          live in the moment! The techniques of meditation that I have learned
          have profoundly calmed and grounded me in dealing with my everyday
          life as well as brought my yoga practice to a whole new level of
          exhilaration and peacefulness. Through different food combinations and
          herbal supplements I’ve learned how sacred preparing and eating meals
          can be. My life has truly benefited. I consider her to be a wonderful
          gift and I look forward to my journey in Ayurveda. Rebecca L
          Pendleton, Fresno CA Following the recommendations of Monika Joshi has
          been the best health decision I have made in years. Incorporating only
          a few of her dietary suggestions has benefited me tremendously. I feel
          calmer and more settled, my food cravings have disappeared and I am
          losing weight without dieting. Ghee has been the best addition to my
          diet. Ghee feels very nourishing, and lubricating, especially to my
          dry throat. Ghee also satisfies my craving for fat and keeps me from
          being hungry between meals and it is very easy to make at home. Monika
          is the only practitioner that I know of who offers custom herb
          formulas. She knew exactly what I needed and herbs have helped me a
          lot. M.D. - Austin, TX
