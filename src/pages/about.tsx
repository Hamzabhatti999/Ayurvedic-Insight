        About Ayurvedha
      </h3>
      <div className="px-20 text-justify pb-10">
        <p>
          The term <strong>Ayurveda</strong> consists of two Sanskrit roots
          “Ayus” and “Veda”. Ayus may be translated as life and Veda as
          knowledge. Hence, Ayurveda is knowledge of life. Sanskrit is the
          language of Ayurveda and the oldest written language on the planet.
          Ayurveda teaches that man is a child of external environment called
          macrocosm. Man is called a microcosm, a universe within himself.
          Ayurveda views health and dis-ease in holistic terms, as per the
          relationship between man the microcosm and universe the macrocosm. The
          harmony between the two creates health and dis-harmony creates
          dis-ease. Ayurveda is the science that brings about the harmony in an
          individual.

        <h3 className="font-bold my-4">The goal of Ayurveda</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of Ayurveda is to create complete wellness with harmony
          between mind, body and spirit and natural resistance to disease
          causing conditions. Modern medicine attempts to restore health by
          treating the symptoms of the body or attacking the disease. Ayurveda
          believes that by balancing the various mind-body functions the natural
          intelligence of the body will automatically bring itself to wellness.
          Ayurveda is complimentary to modern medicine and does not replace
          medical diagnosis or treatment.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold my-4">How is the goal achieved?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Ayurveda recognizes that each person has a unique mind-body
          constitution. Ayurveda then identifies the various components of that
          individual's constitution, determines where imbalances and
          disturbances exist, and provides education, guidance and a plan for
          helping the individual bring about their own improvements in health
          and wellness.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The National Institute of Health Office of Complementary and
          Alternative Medicine currently considers Ayurveda a form of
          complementary and alternative medicine in the United States. In the
          State of California, Ayurveda is a non-licensed profession. Its
          practice was formally legalized under the passage of Senate Bill 577
          in January 2003. Ayurvedic consultations are considered alternative or
          complementary to healing arts that are licensed by the State of
          California.

        <h3 className="font-bold my-4">Ayurvedic Principles</h3>
        <p>
          The ancient wisdom of Ayurveda is based on a deep understanding of the
          forces at work within all of nature. Since we are part of nature, we
          are all created from the same basic elements. They are: space, air,
          fire, water and earth. These are the five elements of the environment
          and also the same forces that are within each one of us. By
          understanding their nature and qualities, we come to understand
          ourselves. The five elements manifest themselves in the functioning of
          the five senses related to hearing, touch, vision, taste and smell.
          Ayurveda recognizes the unique physical and mental constitution or
          make up of an individual and detects the current state of imbalance
          through various techniques. It then offers a wide range of modalities
          to enable individuals to take care of their own health. Ayurveda is
          not a system of healing in which everyone enjoys the same practices.
          There are rarely two treatment plans that are exactly alike.

        <h3 className="font-bold my-4">Dosha</h3>
        <div className="mb-4">
          The physiology of the human being is governed by three main forces
          which are commonly known as the three doshas or humors called Vata,
          Pitta and Kapha. Vata is made up of air and ether, Pitta is made up of
          fire and water and Kapha is made up of water and earth. These three
          humors, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, govern all the biological,
          psychological and physiological functions of the body, mind and
          consciousness. If they are out of balance, the result is disease.
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <strong>VATA</strong> is a combination of the elements Space and Air.
          It is responsible for movement, breathing, heartbeat and creativity.
          Symptoms of <strong>VATA</strong> imbalance may manifest as
          constipation, gas, dryness, indigestion, pain, fatigue, being cold,
          restlessness, anxiety and excessive worry.
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <strong>PITTA</strong> is a combination of the elements Fire and
          Water. It is responsible for warmth, digestion, metabolism and
          intelligence. Symptoms of <strong>PITTA</strong> imbalance may
          manifest as hyperacidity, hypertension, inflammation, rashes, anger,
          jealousy, and irritability.
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <strong>KAPHA</strong> is a combination of the elements Water and
          Earth. It is responsible for structure, lubrication, stamina and
          compassion. Symptoms of <strong>KAPHA</strong> imbalance may manifest
          as congestion, overweight, water retention and lethargy.
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          Optimal Health is the result of a perfect balance between VATA, PITTA
          and <strong>KAPHA</strong>. However, they can be pushed out of balance
          by such factors as Environment, Trauma, Lifestyle, Diet, Stress,
          Toxins and other causes. Hence, the goal of Ayurvedic treatment is to
          help the individual reestablish harmony within themselves and with
          their environment so that the body and mind can heal themselves. As
          everyone is composed of a unique combination of <strong>VATTA</strong>
          ,<strong>PITTA</strong> and <strong>KAPHA</strong> with different
          imbalances, each individual's path towards reestablishing balance and
          optimal health will be unique.
