          <strong>Ayurvedic Consultations</strong> involve a series of
          appointments in which the individual is evaluated and a personalized
          treatment plan is formulated. Over a period of several months,
          Ayurvedic lifestyle, diet, herbs and other treatments are gradually
          introduced and their effects are monitored.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          The Goal of Ayurvedic consultation is to invite you to discover the
          wonderful science of Ayurveda and what it can do for you to create a
          healthy and peaceful life. You may simply be looking for more balance
          in you life or struggling with an existing condition, in either case
          we offer you guidance, support and education to bring harmony to your
          life. When there is harmony there is health and when there is
          disharmony there is disease. A general rule is that it takes six
          months to a year to restore balance depending on the length of
          imbalance and your ability to incorporate the plan into your
          lifestyle. Changes take time and our goal is to attain long term
          changes with benefits of a harmonious life.
