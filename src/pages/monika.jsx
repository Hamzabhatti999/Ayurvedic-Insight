          Health care has always been one of the major aspects of Monika’s life.

          involved in health care of near and dear ones. She has worked in
          different hospital settings for a number of years. She was lead to
          Ayurveda through her own personal and medical issues including losing

          Born and brought up in India, land of Ayurveda, it is in the “West”
          where she found her passion in the most amazing ‘science of life’. The
          basic principle of all 5 elements found in the nature and human body
          plus state of balance within themselves and in relation to the self is
          the most fascinating part of Ayurveda. Journey to health begins when
          one tries to bring the harmony back in life.
